# Indoor-Gps-Positioning
Uwb devices 2D positioning estimation using non-linear Leas-Square method based on trilateration algorithm

3 Anchor and 1 Tag

Anchors have fixed position but diameter of anchors are randomly generated by code. Least-square algorithm takes these diameters and locations and then gives you  the product of least square estimation is tag location.


Tested with DWM1000 indoor gps sensors
Now it's just Matlab code but Python code will be added realy soon.:)
